This is a program that a classmate asked me to write.

The main program realizes to filter out the white pixels in the screen and draw the grid, and modify the color of each grid according to the user's choice. If there is no choice, the color will be filled randomly.

The subroutine is the associator of color and text, which associates the color with the input text. Make the color selection of the main program have text prompts.
